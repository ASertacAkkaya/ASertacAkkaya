# 1. Introduction
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ASertacAkkaya.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things! I professionally have the most experience as a full-stack web developer.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively learning new things as it's part of my passion; I want to become a game developer as a hobbyist while I work to be a master web developer in Laravel!
- ðŸ“« You can send me an email at me@sertac.dev or find me on Twitter under the same handle!

# 2. What's my current toolset?
- I create custom tailored web projects in Laravel (longtime Laravel 5 and 7, currently learning Laravel 10 and all the new stuff).
- For frontend choices, I rely on TailwindCSS and vanilla JavaScript, and I am currently looking to expand into React (or Vue 3)!
- My go to for Windows desktop apps is usually either NodeJS and Electron or C#.NET Framework/Core WPF.
- For web crawlers and data mining, I'm most used to the Python (using Selenium) setup.
- For all sorts of various chat and command bots, I use NodeJS and pair it with MongoDB for the database.
- When I'm 3D modeling, I use Blender, but I'm only as good as low poly cartoony styles...
- For pixel art, I don't think anything can top Aseprite for me!
- For game development, I'm mostly experienced in Unity with its 2D; however, I've been pivoting to Godot for the past two years; it's a lot more intuitive and fast!
- For taking notes and progress tracking, I use Notion!
- I do vector logos sometimes, and I'm comfortable with Illustrator (I started out with Fireworks).
- I code in VS Code for most things except Visual Studio for Unity and Windows Desktop with C# WPF.
- For Wordpress (including WooCommerce), custom themes, or plugin development. I use native meta boxes to implement the GUI.
- For page builders, I use Elementor for Wordpress.
- Git for version control (surprise)!

## 2.1 Honorable mentions I left out of my current toolset (because I don't often work with them anymore, but they're in my general experience)
- My biggest experience in C was implementing a functional chat bot for RFC 1459 using the native socket library. TurboC was my choice of editor at the time.
- Java SE with console, swing, or awt; I used to use NetBeans, but later swapped to IntelliJ IDEA.
- Android native app development using Java with Android Studio.
- Lua that I use still sometimes for various game addons, either creating or editing/updating them (such as Garry's Mod, Don't Starve), I initially learned it for Cocos2d-x.
- PyQt, I learned it to explore, but just like GUI with Java, I couldn't find a good ground of use for it. Later, Electron came and replaced it for me. I used to use PyCharm at the time.
- My ancient raw PHP times with absolutely no framework at all. I went between NetBeans, PHPDesigner, Sublime Text, etc. I am thankful for the VS Code and Atom (now R.I.P.) eras to have arrived.
- Again, ancient times where I have worked on Joomla, OpenCart, and PhpBB (1-2-3).
- VueJS for use with Laravel, but I never expanded too much on it, my last experience was with Vue 2. React could be a good option if it was more standalone on its own.
- Processing and p7.js: I picked them up for homework and various personal niche needs, mostly regarding easy controls and GD. My knowledge comes mostly from The Coding Train!
- OpenFrameworks again for similar reasons as Processing and p7.js. I also got more familiar with C++ and OpenGL thanks to this, and I mostly further expanded my knowledge of GLSL shaders and later into WebGL and HLSL using HTML Canvas.
- VB6 and VB.NET were my first experience developing Windows Desktop apps.
- ASP, no, not ASP.NET; ASP. It was my first choice in web programming, because I heard it often when learning HTML. But I only used it maybe for a year, and maybe another year for ASP.NET, before moving onto PHP 5.
- Bootstrap that I no longer actively use; BulmaCSS that I liked but TailwindCSS later started to top it; in between SemanticUI and the fork FomanticUI for a while; bunch of grid systems before all of this, such as 960.gs and 1140 GS.
- jQuery, ever since the vanilla JS update and modern browsers, I dropped it (can you imagine, I also used to optimize CSS & JS down to IE 7?).
- Mantis Bug Tracker for over 3 years when I was freelancing online at one point.

# 3. What am I currently doing?
- Last year I was working on a custom e-commerce project in Laravel using TALL-stack (TailwindCSS, AlpineJS, Laravel, Livewire) and it has been a great experience!
- This year I'll work on expanding my old codebase, while giving it a code refactor, into Laravel 11 and transforming it into a multi-tenancy, multi-vendor, multi-language e-commerce platform to further push my limits in Laravel!

# 4. What I want to learn
- Learn Vue 3 + Inertia + Pinia for Laravel to pair up on the frontend framework (an alternative to Livewire + AlpineJS).
- Learn React for the frontend and React Native for cross-platform mobile.
- Learn Godot to be my main game development toolset, but master Unity before it for mobile game development!
- Learn Python more in-depth and explore the data analysis part of it rather than just scrape!
- Learn cloud solutions such as OCI and AWS and delve into microservices.
- Learn more about modeling and rigging for game development in Blender, along with expanding upon my shader knowledge and texturing.

# 5. What I want to do
- Put my existing knowledge to use and release corporate solutions for Windows with C#.NET Core.
- Release multiple games, for mobile and desktop, both.
- Put my personal web projects up live!
